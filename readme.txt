#### Group capabilities ####

- Integrates standard WordPress capabilities which can be assigned to groups and users
- Supports custom capabilities: allows to define new capabilities for usage in plugins and web applications
- Users inherit capabilities of the groups they belong to
- Groups inherit capabilities of their parent groups

#### Access control ####

- Built-in access control that allows to restrict access to posts, pages and custom content types to specific groups and users only
- control access to content by groups: shortcodes allow to control who can access content on posts, show parts to members of certain groups or to those who are not members
  Shortcodes: [groups_member], [groups_non_member]
- control access to content by capabilities: show (or do not show) content to users who have certain capabilities
  Shortcodes: [groups_can], [groups_can_not]

#### Easy user interface ####

- integrates nicely with the standard WordPress Users menu
- provides an intuitive Groups menu
- conceptually clean views showing the essentials
- quick filters

#### Sensible options ####

- administrator overrides can be turned off
- optional tree view for groups can be shown only when needed
- provides its own set of permissions
- cleans up after testing with a "delete all plugin data" option 

#### Access Control ####

Access to posts and pages can be restricted by capability.

Any capability can be used to restrict access, including new capabilities.

If access to a post is restricted, only users who belong to a group with that
capability may access the post.

Groups defines the groups_read_post capability by default, which can be
used to restrict access to certain posts or pages to groups
with that capability only. Any other capability (including new ones) can be
used to limit access as well.

#### Framework ####

- Solid and sound data-model with a complete API that allows developers to create group-oriented web applications and plugins

#### Multisite ####

- All features are supported independently for each blog in multisite installations

### Introduction ###

#### Content Access Control ####

##### Access restrictions on posts ####

On posts an pages (and custom content types) a new meta box titled *Access restrictions* appears.
By checking a capability under *Enforce read access*, you can restrict access to the post to groups and users who are members of a group with that capability.
You need to assign this capability to a group and make users members of that group to allow them to see those posts.

#### Content visibility for members and non-members ####

The [groups_member] and [groups_non_member] shortcodes are used to limit visibility of content to users who *are* members of a group or users who *are not* members of a group. Multiple comma-separated groups can be specified.

Example: Limiting visibility of enclosed content to registered users.

[groups_member group="Registered"]

Only registered users can see this text.

[/groups_member]

#### Content visibility based on capabilities ####

The [groups_can] and [groups_can_not] shortcodes limit visibility of enclosed content to those users who *have* the capability or those who *do not have* it. Multiple capabilities can be given.

Example: Showing enclosed content to users who can edit_posts (standard WordPress capability).

[groups_can capability="edit_posts"]

You can see this only if you have the edit_posts capability.

[/groups_can]

### Integration in the 'Users' menu: ###

Users - group membership is managed from the standard Users admin view.
Users are automatically added to the _Registered_ group. You can add multiple users to other groups here and also remove them.

### Sections in the 'Groups' menu: ###

#### Groups ####

Here you can:

- add groups
- remove groups
- assign capabilities to groups

#### Capabilities ####

This is where you add, remove and manage capabilities.

Capabilities can be assigned to groups and users (1). These capabilities include
the *standard WordPress capabilities* but you can also define additional
capabilities for your web-application.

Groups defines the *groups_read_post* capability by default which can be
used to restrict access to certain posts or pages to groups (and users)
with that capability only. Additional capabilities can be identified on the
*Groups > Options* admin screen that may be used to limit access.

(1) Assigning capabilities to users is not integrated in the user interface yet but can be done through API calls.

#### Options ####

##### Administrator override #####

Administrator overrides can be turned off.

##### Permissions #####

For each role these permissions can be set:

* Access Groups: see information related to Groups.
* Administer Groups: complete control over everything related to Groups.
* Administer Groups plugin options: grants access to make changes on the *Groups > Options* admin section.

##### Testing the plugin #####

A convenient option is provided to delete all data that has been stored by the Groups plugin.
This option is useful if you just need to start from fresh after you have been testing the plugin.

### Shortcodes ###

#### Limit content visibility ####

These shortcodes are used to limit the visibility of the content they enclose:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the documentation? =

Most of the features are currently documented at the [Groups plugin page](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/groups/).

The official Groups documentation root is at the [Groups Documentation](http://www.itthinx.com/documentation/groups/) page.
The documentation is a work in progress, if you don't find anything there yet but want to know about the API, please look at the code as it provides useful documentation on all functions.

= I have a question, where do I ask? =

You can leave a comment at the [Groups plugin page](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/groups/).

= I want Advanced and Premium members, where the Premium members can access everything that Advanced members can access. How can I do that? =

Example: Advanced and Premium members

1. Go to *Groups > Capabilities* and define two new capabilities, let's call them *advanced* and *premium*.
2. Go to *Groups > Groups* and define two new  groups, let's call them *Advanced Members* and *Premium Members* - select *Advanced Members* as the *Parent* for the *Premium Members* group.
3. Assign the *advanced* capability to the *Advanced Members* group and the *premium* capability to the *Premium Members* group.
4. Go to *Groups > Options* and tick the checkboxes for *advanced* and *premium* under _Access restrictions_ and hit the *Save* button at the end of the page.
5. Now create an example post that only members of the *Advanced Members* group should be able to see and tick the *advanced* checkbox under _Access restrictions_.
6. Create another post for *Premium Members* and tick the *premium* checkbox for that post.
7. Assign test users to both groups, log in as each user in turn and see which posts will be accessible. 

= How do I limit access to posts so that users in group A can not read the same as those in group B and vice-versa? =

Example: Green and Red members

1. Go to *Groups > Capabilities* and define two new capabilities, call them *green* and *red*.
2. Go to *Groups > Groups* and define two new  groups, let's call them *Green Members* and *Red Members*
3. Assign the *green* capability to the *Green Members* group and the *red* capability to the *Red Members* group.
4. Go to *Groups > Options* and tick the checkboxes for *green* and *red* under _Access restrictions_ and hit the *Save* button at the end of the page.
5. Now create an example post that only members of the *Green Members* group should be able to see and tick the *green* checkbox under _Access restrictions_.
6. Create another post for *Red Members* and tick the *red* checkbox for that post.
7. Assign a test user to any of the above groups, log in as that user and the post will be accessible.
